# Overview
- In this repo, I review some of the key concepts & code of AI like:
    - LLMs (VLMs)
    - Agents

# What is it for?:
    - The goal is to have a simple reference code to review / look back at these concepts, in this rapidly moving field.
    - I used knowledge from various sources & my work experience to review these concepts. References will be listed along with code/notebooks.
    - This will not include any proprietary code that I worked on for my companies in the last 7 years.
    - Its WIP, and will be updated with more components (like VLMs, Diffusion, GANs, etc.)
